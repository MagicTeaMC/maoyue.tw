# Why Astro?

First, Astro can be modularization, so it only require a few change for adding a new page. Second reason is that it is easy to learn. Unlike react, PHP or other similar alternative. I don't need to learn a new language/syntax just for creating a new website. The other reason, I wanna make a website that isn't BLOAT, a lightweight (<100KB) website is what I need (And every website should, but....). And the last, and the most important -- Astro is fully free and open source, no trackers, no propiertary code, only my content.

# Why blog?

After years, I want to write something on my website again, but I might recover my old article to this website first.
